We manage our templates for doing code review as [saved replies](https://github.com/settings/replies). Add these to your code review process by: 

1. Going to https://github.com/settings/replies
2. Adding a new reply for each [code review template](/code-review-templates/) by copying and pasting the markdown
3. Using the reply as part of code review!
