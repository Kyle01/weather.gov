# Environments

There are two tiers of environments - unstable and stable. 

## Unstable

### Local/Development

See [dev docs](dev/) for information on running the application locally. We use docker with composer to manage the application locally.

### Developer Sandboxes/QA

These are developer specific spaces that are not assumed to be stable. They are used for sharing feature work with designers and previewing work that will merge into main. 

Deployments can be made with the Github Action. 

## Stable

### Staging

### Beta
