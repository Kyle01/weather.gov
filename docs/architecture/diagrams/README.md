# Architectural Diagrams

We use PlantUML for diagraming our architecture. You can use the vscode [plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jebbs.plantuml) for generating the diagrams from configuration stored in this git repository. Diagrams will be stored in PlantUML and as images in the docs/architecutre/diagrams folder.
