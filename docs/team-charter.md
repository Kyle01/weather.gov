# Weather.gov 2.0 Team Charter

## Working agreements
- No ownership or ego, but continuously clarify expectations on responsibility and collaborate with each other.
- “It’s important to be collaborative, but also knowing what is my responsibility makes me feel empowered”
- Don’t let conflict fester. Say it out loud, bring it to the group or if it’s interpersonal, have a 1:1. We are all open to those conversations.
- Humor = safety. If a team doesn’t feel safe, there’s not humor
- Empathy reigns supreme. Care for each other and our users - it trickles down to our work.
- Strong opinions, loosely held. Come with an opinion and an open mind for disagreement and changes.
- By default, trust the integrity of each other’s work
- Respect everyone’s expertise. Each other, our partners, our users.
- We’re planting seeds. You might think you’re failing, you’re actually not. People might not take our advice, even if they don’t do that - we’re planting seeds.

**To do our best work**
- Freedom to share early and often for quick feedback or a gut check. 
  - Create time and space for people to think, especially big things: 5-10 min in meetings to review docs before discussing or share 24 hours ahead
  - if you disagree do so in a respectful and kind way: provide feedback, bring up risks, rooted in an open mind
- Some of us want heads down time, some of us want think out loud time. We can’t set a standard so instead be conscious about this and ask for what people prefer. 
- Lean on each other for help, but clarify what you need help with, who might be a good person.
- Don’t let devs make design decisions. Let’s collaborate on this stuff, identify possibilities and limitations, but don’t let the tech determine the UX.
- Use time estimates and deadlines to communicate priorities and align expectations, not to micromanage delivery
- When discussing a topic or making decisions in a meeting, be prepared to dive into the details while being mindful of time
- This is a new team with people in new roles, feel free to explicitly ask “what I need from you, what do you need from me?”

## How we work

**We are not a scrum team. We are an agile team** that uses a mix of scrum and kanban project management practices. These are fairly common practices across other agile teams, tweaked to fit our team and to easily onboard others onto the project. 

Everything should be based on **outcomes > outputs**. Outcomes are goals we need to achieve in order to be successful.

These outcomes are correlated to work that can be broken down into **3 different “sizes”** from big to small, strategic to tactical:

| Big and Strategic | | Small and Tactical |
| :----------- | :-------------| :-------------|
| **Epics** identify a large user need or area of work. **Stories** specify the value we need to provide. | **Spikes > Flows > Layouts > Components** clearly define solutions and capabilities. | **Tasks** are tactical to-dos that an individual can use to track their work. |

**Additional definitions**
- We write features using a user story format to remind us that everything we build is to serve a user need – As a [user + context], I need to do [x] in order to achieve [y].
- We use a backlog to list and track our work across phases.
- A sprint is a two week increment of work that’s planned out
- A spike is a timeboxed (< 1 sprint) exploration to evaluate opportunities, risks, and limitations of a new technology or idea
- Git terminology
  - Tickets (aka Github issues) track our work
  - Branches
  - Pull requests
  - Releases

## Who's involved

**There are 4 general levels of ownership**

![diagram of the four levels of ownership and their authority](/docs/img/weathergov-authority-levels.png)

### Executive Champions
  - **Led by:** Ken Graham, NWS Director and Michelle Mainelli, NWS Acting Deputy Director
  - **They are responsible for** setting organizational priorities and allocating funds, attention, and people across many initiatives in order to maintain its critical services, maximize its impact, and support its people.
  - **They are not responsible for** directing the strategy or defining success for Weather.gov 2.0, nor are they responsible for how the site gets built. They should always have visibility into progress, provide feedback, and can at any point veto strategic decisions.

### Primary Champions
  - **Led by:** George Jungbluth, Acting Director of the Office of Dissemination and Jason Tuell, NWS Eastern Region Director
  - **They are responsible for** aligning Weather.gov 2.0’s vision, strategy, and rollout within the organization. They work across the org to get buy-in and support, they assign resources, and monitor progress towards outcomes.
  - **They are not responsible for** how the strategy is executed, e.g. what’s built and how it’s built. They should always have visibility into progress, provide feedback, and can at any point veto critical executional decisions.

### Product Team
  - **Led by:** Kari Sheets, Weather.gov 2.0 Product Owner and Shad Keene, Weather.gov 2.0 Deputy Product Owner
  - **They are responsible for** weather.gov 2.0’s strategy, delivery, and impact on users. They prioritize, execute, uphold standards and compliance, and communicate out progress regularly.
  - **They are not responsible for** the data, content, and integrity of guidance that NWS provides to the public and partners. 

### Subject Matter Experts
  - **They are responsible for** implementing and supporting weather.gov 2.0 as it’s being developed and rolled out.
  - **They are not responsible for** the weather.gov site experience, bugs. However they will be active contributors to making the site better.

### How will decisions be made
The goal is to inform strategic decisions based on user needs and then validate them in testing. This process requires 
  - the tightest possible feedback loop between the product team leading the work and the primary champions overseeing its success 
  - a consensus or consent-based model where explicit commitment is sought from a majority over complete unanimity

Otherwise, the product team will spend more time justifying the work rather than doing it and learning from it.

### How will feedback on the product be sought and given
The end user is prioritized over everyone. 

The product team is responsible for getting feedback regularly from users, considering a starting place that you only need to test with 5 users ([source](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/why-you-only-need-to-test-with-5-users/)). Additional feedback from subject matter experts in areas such as data, policy, security, technology will be sought as needed or as encouraged by the primary champions in order to provide greater context.

However, proactive feedback does not require an immediate reaction. The product team is responsible for hearing all feedback and considering it in their execution.
